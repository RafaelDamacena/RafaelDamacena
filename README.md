Hi There! 
I'm Rafael Damacena. I'm 20 years old, and I've always been passionate about technology, I grew up interested in games, programming and learning English. After knowing how to use it, I also wanted to understand how everything works, so I decided to introduce myself to programming, which is an area that, in addition to learning very quickly, I really enjoy doing and learning.
 I'm a full-stack website developer and I love programming. I've always been interested in programming,but I confess that I recently delved deeper into this market.
My main knowledge is in Python. I am constantly studying and improving my skills,including the front-end, until its deployment. I like to develop websites completely, from their blank code,from back to front-end.I develop custom visuals, as well as any functions andimplementations that a website needs or wants. As a programmer, we need to recognize that we will be constantly learning,and for that, I have the pleasure of being resilient to learn new tools, study and apply them as soon as possible, and without difficulty.
