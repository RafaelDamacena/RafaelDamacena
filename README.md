Hi There! 
I'm Rafael Damacena. I'm a full-stack website developer and I love programming. I've always been interested in programming,
but I confess that I recently delved deeper into this market.
My main knowledge is in Python. I am constantly studying and improving my skills,
including the front-end. I like to develop websites completely, from their blank code,
from back to front-end.I develop custom and custom visuals, as well as any functions and
implementations that a website needs or wants. As a programmer, we need to recognize that we will be constantly learning,
and for that, I have the pleasure of being resilient to learn new tools, study and apply them as soon as possible, and without difficulty.
